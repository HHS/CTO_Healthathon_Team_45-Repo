[Repo Management]


[Team Leads]:

Team Leads are responsible for managing all access requests, adding or removing user accounts, and approving or denying Pull Request submissions within their designated repo. We recommend that you refer to https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications in order to configure notifications and receive timely updates. For all technical, repo, or account issues, please email Domenic Caruano: Domenic.Caruano@hhs.gov.



[Participants]:

Participants are responsible for managing their source code, commits, comments, and submitted Pull Requests. We recommend that first-time users create or upload files within the "Code" section and refer to https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/about-commits for more details. When submitting a Pull Request for a "file merge" or general updates, please reach out to your Team Lead directly for awareness. For accessibility issues with your designated repo, please reach out to your Team Lead to resolve the issue.
